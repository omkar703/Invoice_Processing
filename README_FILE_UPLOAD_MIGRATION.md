# Invoice Processor API - Direct File Upload Migration

## Overview
The FastAPI application has been successfully migrated from using AWS S3 for file storage to accepting direct file uploads. This change simplifies the architecture and removes the dependency on AWS services.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Request Models Updated (`app/models/schemas.py`)
- Removed S3-based request models (`InvoiceProcessRequest` and `OCRDataRequest` with file_keys)
- Now uses FastAPI's `UploadFile` directly in route functions
- Updated documentation strings to reflect direct file upload functionality

### 2. File Validation Added (`app/utils/file_validation.py`)
- **New file**: Comprehensive file validation utilities
- Supports PDF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, and WebP formats
- File size limits: 50MB per file, 200MB total
- Maximum 20 files per request
- Content type validation and file extension checking

### 3. Routes Updated
#### OCR Routes (`app/routes/ocr_routes.py`)
- `/extract-ocr-data` endpoint now accepts `List[UploadFile]` parameter
- Removed S3 service dependency
- Added file validation before processing
- Updated error messages to reflect filename instead of S3 keys

#### Invoice Routes (`app/routes/invoice_routes.py`)
- `/process-invoices` endpoint now accepts `List[UploadFile]` parameter  
- Removed S3 service dependency
- Added file validation before processing
- Updated processing logic to work with uploaded files

### 4. S3 Service Deprecated (`app/services/s3_service.py`)
- Entire file commented out and marked as deprecated
- S3 service instance creation removed
- All S3-related functionality disabled

### 5. Configuration Updated (`app/core/config.py`)
- AWS/S3 configuration parameters commented out and marked as deprecated
- Application description updated to reflect direct file upload capability
- Settings validation no longer requires AWS credentials
- Only GROQ API key is now required

### 6. Application Startup Updated (`main.py` and `app/main.py`)
- Startup messages updated to reflect new file upload functionality
- Removed references to S3 bucket access in startup logs

## API Usage Changes

### Before (S3-based)
```json
POST /extract-ocr-data
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "file_keys": ["invoice1.pdf", "invoice2.jpg"]
}
```

### After (Direct Upload)
```bash
POST /extract-ocr-data
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# Using curl
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/extract-ocr-data" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "files=@invoice1.pdf" \
  -F "files=@invoice2.jpg"
```

## File Support
- **PDF files**: All pages are processed individually
- **Image files**: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, WebP
- **Size limits**: 50MB per file, 200MB total per request
- **Quantity limit**: Maximum 20 files per request

## Configuration Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### No Longer Required
```bash
# These are no longer needed:
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
# S3_BUCKET_NAME=
```

## Benefits of Direct File Upload
1. **Simplified Architecture**: No need for S3 bucket setup and management
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed boto3 and AWS SDK dependencies
3. **Lower Costs**: No AWS S3 storage and data transfer costs
4. **Better Security**: Files are processed in-memory without persistent storage
5. **Improved Performance**: No network calls to download files from S3
6. **Easier Deployment**: No AWS credentials configuration required

## Testing the Changes

### Start the Application
```bash
cd deployment
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Test with Sample Files
```bash
# Test OCR endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/extract-ocr-data" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "files=@sample_invoice.pdf"

# Test invoice processing endpoint  
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/process-invoices" \
  -H "accept: text/csv" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "files=@invoice1.pdf" \
  -F "files=@invoice2.jpg"
```

### Access API Documentation
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

The interactive documentation will now show file upload forms instead of JSON input fields for the main processing endpoints.

## Migration Notes
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Error handling has been updated to use filenames instead of S3 keys
- Logging messages updated to reflect file upload processing
- File processing logic remains unchanged - only the input method has changed

The migration maintains full backward compatibility in terms of output format and processing capabilities while providing a more straightforward and cost-effective file input method.
